# Introduction

Project goal is to simplify the usage of the CQRS Pattern under backbone.js by 
providing needed infrastructure.

# Usage

To use CQRS on the clientside and inside Backbone.js we will need to push _events_ 
to the browser. You can achieve this via websockets, flash, long polling or any 
other technique around.

## Initialization

To configure Backbone.CQRS you got to init the `Backbone.CQRS.hub`.

	// given your events look something like this
	var event = {
		name: 'personChanged', // the unique name of this event
		payload: {
			id: 'someId', // the provided id should match the Backbone.Model.Id
			anotherValue: 'something'
		}	
	};

	// you can go with defaults
	Backbone.CQRS.hub.init();

You can override a few values on initialisation:

	Backbone.CQRS.hub.init({

		// messageing channels
        commandsChannel: 'commands',
        eventsChannel: 'events',

        // field lookup
        eventNameAttr: 'name',
        eventModelIdAttr: 'payload.id',
        eventResponseToCommandId: 'commandId',

        // override the default parse
        parseEvent: function(msg) {
        	var data = JSON.parse(msg);
	        return {
	            name: data.eventName,
	            payload: data.payload,
	            commandId: data.commandId
	        };
	    }
	});


## Wire up commands and events to/from sever

The interface to Backbone.CQRS is provided through `Backbone.CQRS.hub`:

	// pass in events from your socket
	mySocket.on('events', function(data){
		Backbone.CQRS.hub.emit('events', data);
	});

	// pass commands to socket
	Backbone.CQRS.hub.on('commands', function(data) {
		mySocket.emit('commands', data);
	});

## Denormalize event data to you model

First create a denormalizer:

    var personCreatedHandler = new Backbone.CQRS.EventDenormalizer({
        forModel: 'person',
        forEvent: 'personChanged'
    });

    var person = Backbone.Model.extend({modelName: 'person'});

    var me = new person({id: '1'});
    me.bindCQRS();

all _personChanged_ events for id = 1 will be applied to the personModel by simply 
set the event data to the model. You could override the apply function like this to 
get more control:

	var person = Backbone.Model.extend({

		modelName: 'person',

        apply: function(data) {
        	if (data.name === 'personChanged') {
        		this.set(data.payload);
        	}

        }
	});

For creational events which aren't applied to an existing model you could 
override the _handle_ function in the eventdenormalizer:

    var PersonCreateHandler = Backbone.CQRS.EventDenormalizer.extend({
        handle: function(evt) {
            // do something
            var person = new person(evt.payload);
            app.persons.add(person);
        }
    });

    var personCreateHandler = new PersonCreateHandler({
        forModel: 'person',
        forEvent: 'personCreated'
    });

## send commands

To send commands just:

    var cmd = new Backbone.CQRS.Command({
        commandName: 'changePerson',
        payload: {
            id: 8,
            name: 'my name'
        }
    });

    // emit it
    cmd.emit();

if you want to react on events in respond to a command you can:

    var cmd = new Backbone.CQRS.Command({
        commandName: 'changePerson',
        payload: {
            id: 8,
            name: 'my name'
        }
    });

    // observe it
    cmd.observe(function(event) {
    	// do something
    });

    // emit it
    cmd.emit();

By default backbone.CQRS will look for a field `commandId` in the event. You can 
override this value or provide a own function to get the commandId in which the event 
was send as response:

	Backbone.CQRS.hub.init({

        eventResponseToCommandId: 'commandId', // override with another value

        // override the getCommandId function
        getCommandId: function(data) {
            return data.msgId.substring(0, msg.indexOf('.')); // or whatever
        }
	});
